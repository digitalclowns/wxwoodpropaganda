Other notes:
Astronomy nerddd, obviously obsessed with the moon but also space in general if their quote for Brightshade sword means anything. And knowing life there's something else too I just gotta deep deeper.




Pigeon just jots down whatever, in purple: 
* I recommend using the other wiki instead, since it's much the same content but generally a better platform: https://dontstarve.wiki.gg/wiki/WX-78 
* Although they have at least 1 quote in which they ask fellow survivors not to touch them (the heat-generating circuit, in which they don’t want their minions to huddle against them for warmth), they still have a few quotes in which they apparently want touch on their own terms. Like asking Wolfgang to carry them. And two different quotes about wanting to be hand fed 
   * Honey Nuggets: "PLEASE INSERT INTO MOUTH"
   * Grim Galette: "NOW SLIDE IT INTO MY MOUTH"
   * Still, they’re often germaphobic, of course. Just that germaphobia doesn’t seem to always stop them from choosing to be in contact with organics 


* Frequently a hypocrite. Like how they’ll initially act like they’re above competition, that that’s for fleshlings. But then they quickly get obsessed with it. Prize Ticket- "THE FEATHERED FLESHSACKS SEEM TO ATTACH VALUE TO THIS WORTHLESS PAPER. FOOLS”, Prize Tickets (small stack)- "MY COLLECTION GROWS”, Prize Tickets (large stack)- "THEY'RE MINE! THEY'RE ALL MINE!” ‘Cause of course they have to go for any chance to feel superior.
   * This also applied to them as a gardener, where initially they yell at plants to grow faster, but then when the plants are in actual danger, they quickly become protective of them. Fruit Fly- "ONLY I AM PERMITTED TO THREATEN THE ORGANICS”, Farm Plant (full weed)- "AN IMPOSTER IN MY GARDEN!” They also seem very happy and invested when the crops yield a giant harvest. Giant Carrots- "AS YOU CAN SEE, MY GARDENING TECHNIQUE PRODUCED SUPERIOR RESULTS”, Giant Watermelon- "I AM THE SUPERIOR GARDENER”, Giant Potato- "I AM PROUD OF THIS ONE” (So much for not caring about gardening or plants)
   * Similarly, they have a lot of quotes about being disgusted by love. In DS1, especially, they seem put off by organic creatures following them (like Pogs and Ballphins). But in DST, the idea of creatures following them has apparently grown on them. Like with a lot of their quotes for critters, Polly Roger and the friendly fruit fly. Probably to do with being around the other survivors, realizing that companions can be helpful 
   * Despite how often they’re Ew Love, they still want to be everyone’s center of attention, like wanting the other survivors to make artwork of them. Wanting to be the leader (even though both shorts and quotes make it clear that they aren’t one of the leaders of the group). Often getting bratty and impudent when they aren’t getting the Goldilocks Just Right Doting that they want


* Often paranoid about the other survivors hurting them and fellow machines
   * Plus their more valid anxieties about much of the constant in general, and how they look anxious in so much official art. 


* Vicious Organics Good, if these are on their side, or at least not targeting them. Vicious Organics Bad if attacking them, usually 


* Lot of jokes and puns. (DST characters try to not be cheesy and cringe challenge: impossible) Also, sometimes their quotes sound uncannily like Wormwood’s speech pattern
   * One example I have on hand - Seasoning salt: "TINY FLAVOR ROCKS" 
      * And calling tentacles flesh wobblers 
      * Having the exact same name for moleworms as Wormwood, calling them “DIGGER”, specifically in their Moggles quote ”DIGGER HAS CURIOUS SIGHT”
   * Also, I think they actually get confused about things at least slightly more often than Wormwood does. Of course, they’re only occasionally clueless, but I swear, it’s still a higher percentage of the time than Wormwood (or at the very least, roughly equal. Maybe evident with them more of the time since they tend to be the wordier one) 
      * A few of my favorite clueless sounding quotes of theirs - Announce Under Leaf Canopy: "THE TREES HAVE KILLED THE SUN", Frog legs: "REPLACEMENT PARTS FOR FROGS", Inspect self: "THERE IS A HANDSOME ROBOT TRAPPED IN THIS LOOK-DEVICE!" …..and more, including mistaking a lot of things for robot pieces. 
      * Some more examples, especially them not understanding how humans’ minds work anymore: Feather Pencil- "WHY IS THE FEATHER SO APPEALING? EXPLAIN NOW, FLESHLINGS”, Magnificent Adornment- "I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS RITUAL”, Rook Figure- "WHY ARE HUMANS SO COMPELLED TO "DECORATE"?”


-I’d also mention the “seeing machines as family” under this tbh. -Ink
* Lazy. Would like minions to do as much for them as possible. Also has hoped multiple big scary bosses might carry out mass destruction for them, while they just do the delegating
   * Though of course, they still have their many quotes about being destructive and/or a bully, themself 


* At least a few quotes about “saving” fish from water, even while stating that they intend to eat the fish. I dunno if they actually think they’re saving the fish or not. 


* On one hand, mainly liking the inorganic aspects of the moon, and being disconcerted by geode fruit being a mix of organic and inorganic. And offended by the monkey queen comparing the moon to bananas. On the other hand, flowers being basically among the very few organic things that they call beautiful. And they find the funcap whimsical, even though most of the humans find it gross and/or unnerving. And their well-known pumpkin quotes, and so on (Basically, I continue to find it funny imagining various ways they’d initially feel conflicted about Wormwood) (HYPOCRITE SPOTTED!!)


* Often seems to hate noisy stuff Baritone Shell Bell- "WHAT A HORRIBLE NOISE”, Soprano Shell Bell- "GO BACK TO THE HORRIBLE WATER WHERE YOU BELONG”


They seem self neglectful. I mean their gameplay mechanics (overload + while I don’t think it causes damage, the circuit removal is a bit violent + their arm falling off which kinda shows that they don’t fully repair themself(?) oh also ripping out their empathy module -Ink/Pix
