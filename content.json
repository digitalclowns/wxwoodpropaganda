        "text": "Ah, my very dear WX-78: the soulless automaton and local self proclaimed \"ruthless killing machine\" of the Don't Starve universe. My personal top #2 favorite character (only surpassed by Webber for a mere inch) and my current main in-game.<br><br>What is there for me not to like about WX-78? They're a robot, they're canonically non binary (which is a really funny thing to me if we see this from a programming/coding point of view- robots usually have binary code integrated in their programming and yet WX is non binary. One could say they operate on non-binary code. Haha.), they use exclusively they/them pronouns (I wish that was me), and specially they're cold, ruthless and emotionless. Truly the pinnacle of perfection- the perfect yet dystopian image of the scientist who rejects the weakness of their own flesh and emotions to become a machine driven by nothing nbut logic (and perhaps violence in WX-78's case).<br><br>... Or so the trope they're based on wants us to believe.<br><br>Is WX-78 truly a soulless automaton, or a broken human soul hiding behind a metal shell, afraid of their own emotions?<br><br>Let us see what's this robot's deal in this character analysis that I bring you!",

        "text": "The first thing we ought to know is that WX-78 was not always the automaton we know (and love) today. As seen in the official animated short <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDfzBh_p2YM&pp=ugMICgJlcxABGAHKBQ53eC03OCBhbmltYXRpYw%3D%3D' style='color: #bb8354; text-decoration: underline;' target='_blank'>\"Disconnected\"</a> they were an inventor -presumably named Woodrow as the <a href='https://dontstarve.wiki.gg/images/thumb/WX-78_Sound_File_Woodrow_Prefixes.png/800px-WX-78_Sound_File_Woodrow_Prefixes.png?64f33d' style='color: #bb8354; text-decoration: underline;' target='_blank'>names in the audio files in the game</a> allow us to infer- once, a colleague of Robert Wagstaff with a peculiar dedication to experimenting in the field of mechanical prosthetics- one can assume this was in the hopes of developing what later would become their biggest (and dare I say most special) project: a complete robotic body that would act as a replacement for their own human body.<br><br>Our scientist would take notes and notice the animals they had modified, giving them mechanical prosthetic limbs; as a result these animals would react erratically and/or extremely irritable after the transplants. Yet our researcher dismissed this as being nothing but the organic component of the critters interfering. They persisted on their research with (most likely) the help of Wagstaff. After all, the scientist yearned to transcend the weakness of their own flesh by becoming metal- a soulless automaton, a machine devoid of the imperfections and weakness of the human condition.<br><br>The experiment was, quoting their official Compendium entry, a \"[RESOUNDING SUCCESS]\"... or so they thought at first. <br><br> As we get to learn later on in the short, WX-78 kept working alongside Wagstaff to create a portal to The Constant (something that we will not discuss here, since this is another can of worms and it's mostly Wagstaff related), but as WX-78 worked, they kept getting glimpses of human hands- glimpses of their old human self. But how could this be? They were supposed to be perfect now. Without the weakness of their human flesh, WX-78 should be able to work without any complications. <br><br> Once again, they blamed the organic component -this time their own- for the seeming imperfection in what should have been the perfect automaton body.",
