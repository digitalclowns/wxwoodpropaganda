# wxwoodpropagandathesequel
A  HTML website dedicated to make a character analysis of WX-78, one of my personal favorite characters (IF not THE favorite, only surpassed by Webber) from the games Don't Starve and Don't Starve Together (and spread the wxwood propaganda/agenda in the process).
The art used for this website was made by <h ref=https://www.klei.com> Klei Entertainment</h> and <h ref=https://waokevale.tumblr.com>Waokevale</h>.
I would also like to credit my friends from the "Wxwood Heck" discord server, specially <h ref=https://pigeon-gryphon.tumblr.com>Pigeon</h> and <h ref=https://www.tumblr.com/squid-ink-on-toast>Ink/Pixel</h> for their observations and notes in my shared Google Docs which allowed me to get a better insight into WX-78's character, and <h ref=https://waokevale.tumblr.com> Waokevale</h> for the "Why Wxwood works" essay which provides pretty much the same, as well as a better exploration on WX-78's dynamics and interactions with other characters (Wormwood specially, for obvious reasons).
And finally I wanna thank the Wxwood Heck discord server for the emotional support and encouragement they gave me to do this, and my teacher for the classes- I had a lot of fun learning HTML and CSS and I'm excited to continue learning more, even if not in his class anymore.
